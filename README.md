# Autonomous-Stair-Climbing-Robot
This is the repository to the work done by Team Tech Tequila for the Autonomous Stair Traversal Problem Statement of Flipkart GRiD 2.0.

The work comprises:

1. Simulations computed on Matlab for Load Stability and Velocity Analysis.
2. A Mobile Interface App written using Flutter Framework for monitoring the Bot.
3. Stair Detection and Orientation Analysis Algorithms written in Python.
4. A Simulink Simulation of the Bot Traversing Stairs
